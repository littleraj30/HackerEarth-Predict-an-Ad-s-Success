Based on the demographic information provided, you need to predict whether the revenue generated will cover costs to produce and air the ad. This will help guide decision making for the firm, as they will want to pursue ads that are likely to generate a net gain for their clients— thereby bolstering the advertising firm’s reputation.

Data set

The dataset contains all the essential parameters that determine whether an advertisement can successfully incur any gains for the brand. For this particular dataset, the training set includes details such as country, time, and duration of airing the advertisement, sex that was mainly targeted for the ad, genre of the ad and industry that the product belonged to, ratings metric to gauge how much of the targeted demographic watched the ad, economic health during which the ad was aired, relationship status of the ad's most responsive customers, expenses of product/service offered in the ad, and whether or not a refund is offered in case of customer dissatisfaction.
